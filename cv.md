## Profile

Security-minded homelab & DevOps practitioner focused on Linux, containers, virtualization, and cost-efficient cloud. I design, harden, and operate self-hosted services (GitLab CE, Crafty Controller, media automation stacks, and much more) across Proxmox, TrueNAS, Docker/Podman, and OCI—automating where it helps and documenting everything as much as I can.

## Core Skills

- **Platforms & OS:** Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora (KDE), Proxmox VE, TrueNAS
- **Containers & Orchestration:** Docker, Podman, Compose, Nginx Proxy Manager
- **Networking & Security:** UFW/iptables, Fail2Ban, SSH hardening, Cloudflare DNS/Proxy, TLS/Let’s Encrypt
- **DevOps & CI/CD:** Git/GitLab CI, IaC (Terraform/OpenTofu basics), Ansible (basics)
- **Web & Apps:** Nginx, Nextcloud AIO, Crafty Controller (Minecraft), Media Automation (Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr)
- **Languages & Scripting:** Bash, Python (basics), YAML/TOML, Markdown
- **Observability & Ops:** Log rotation, container log drivers, resource monitoring

## Selected Projects

- **Homelab Infrastructure (multi-node)**  
  Proxmox hypervisor (Vega), TrueNAS storage (Altair), GitLab CE (Deneb), Docker host (Polaris), Debian services (Capella), workstations (Orion/Sirius). Hardened SSH, UFW, Fail2Ban; standardized naming, IP schemes, and docs.

- **Media Automation Stack (Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr)**  
  Designed and maintained an automated media library management system using the Arr ecosystem. Orchestrated services with Docker Compose, ensured persistent storage with TrueNAS, and implemented reverse proxy access via Nginx and Cloudflare.

- **Minecraft Hosting with Crafty Controller**  
  Ran modded servers (Java 21/NeoForge), added WebSockets/Nginx TLS, operational runbooks, and safe force-stop procedures.

- **Senior Capstone – Realtor Web App**  
  Agile workflows, Git, CI/CD; deployed full-stack app. Source: <https://github.com/derrickdryer/senior-capstone>

## Education

- **B.S. in Computer Information Systems**, Summa Cum Laude  
  Pennsylvania Western University — 2021 to 2025

## Certifications & Training

- **Boot.dev – Backend Developer Pathway** (in progress)

## Ongoing Learning

- Systems hardening (UFW, Fail2Ban, SSH)
- Container security & logging strategies
- IaC with Terraform/OpenTofu; Ansible playbooks
- Nginx reverse proxy patterns; Cloudflare best practices

## Clearances (optional)
