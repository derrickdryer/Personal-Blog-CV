# About

Hi, I’m Derrick Dryer — an IT Hardware Technician and an aspiring Linux System Administrator.

By day, I keep desktops, laptops, and secure systems running smoothly. By night, I dive into my homelab where I experiment with Linux, Proxmox, Docker, and TrueNAS — building, breaking, and learning along the way.

I’m also expanding my skill set beyond hardware and sysadmin:

- Following the **Boot.dev Backend Developer Pathway**, sharpening my coding and backend fundamentals
- Studying for industry certifications (Linux, networking, and cloud-focused) to back up my hands-on experience
- Actively reading books on technology, systems design, and professional growth to round out my learning

This site is my space to document projects, share lessons, and track my growth from hardware support to full-fledged system administration or wherever life takes me.
