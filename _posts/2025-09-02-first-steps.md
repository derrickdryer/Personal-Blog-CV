**Hey there!** Welcome to the very first post on my blog — part journal, part documentation, and a little bit of whatever else it turns into. I’m not a professional writer, so bear with me as I figure this out along the way.
{: .message }

## Why start this?

I decided to start this site as a place to showcase what I’m doing. Even if no one ever reads it, I’ll feel accomplished just knowing I got the CI/CD pipeline working well enough to “set it and forget it.” Not to mention, I want anyone aspiring to get into tech — like I was many years ago — to know that it doesn’t take a giant leap, just a little hop.

Before going further, I should mention this is an extreme hyperfixation for me. I love doing it all: coding, hardware, tinkering, and everything in between. My knowledge sometimes feels vast but shallow in spots, so bear with me as you join me on this journey.

## Where I’m at now

Right now, I work as an IT Hardware Technician during the day. From installing PCs to replacing peripherals, imaging computers, and troubleshooting — I’m your guy. But once I clock out, I’m always doing _something_ tech-related: learning on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/), reading a CCNA book, or rebuilding my homelab for the umpteenth time. My hands and mind rarely sit still.

My family loves to joke, _“aRe YoU hAcKiNg RiGhT nOw!?”_ — since all they usually see is either random code on my screen or me nuking yet another LXC I misconfigured. I’m no stranger to tech illiteracy and do my best to help my fellow barbarians “smash their rock against another rock” a little more effectively.

Outside of work, my humble homelab that started on just a laptop has grown into real equipment:

- **3x Raspberry Pi 5s** (not a cluster, just a cluster case)
- **UGREEN 6-bay NAS** running TrueNAS (UGREEN NASync still needs time to mature)
- **Mini-PC** with 8 cores and 16 threads running Proxmox VE

Once I have more space, I plan to add a proper 1U server and maybe even a rack to house it all.

## What to expect

This site is going to be a bit of a mixed bag — part lab notebook, part personal log, part career journal. Expect to see:

- Homelab builds, breakages, and experiments (the good, the bad, and the “why did I do that?”)
- Real-world troubleshooting notes that future-me (and maybe you) will thank me for
- Write-ups from my backend developer learning path
- Book notes & takeaways as I grind through cert prep and tech reads
- Career reflections, wins, and lessons learned along the way

My goal is to keep things honest, slightly technical, and hopefully useful — whether you’re building your first Raspberry Pi project, wrangling a messy homelab, or just curious how someone else is navigating the tech world.

This is just the start — thanks for reading. I hope to see you back soon!
